#  Generate music with an RNN

## About

Welcome to the tutorial on generating musical notes using a simple Recurrent Neural Network (RNN). In this tutorial, you will learn how to train an RNN model to predict the next musical note in a sequence, based on a collection of piano MIDI files from the MAESTRO dataset. By the end of this tutorial, you will be able to generate longer sequences of musical notes using your trained model.

## Introduction

Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) are a type of artificial neural network designed to handle sequences of data. In this tutorial, we will use an RNN to generate musical notes based on patterns learned from a dataset of piano MIDI files. The model will be trained to predict the next note in a sequence, allowing us to generate new musical compositions.

## Parsing MIDI Files
In this section, we'll explore how to parse MIDI files to extract musical note sequences. The provided code will help you read and preprocess MIDI files from the MAESTRO dataset.

## Creating the RNN Model
Learn how to build a simple Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) model for musical note generation. We'll define the architecture of the model using TensorFlow/Keras.

## Training the Model
In this step, we'll train the RNN model using the parsed MIDI data. You'll configure the training process, including defining loss functions and optimizing the model's parameters.

## Generating Musical Notes
Once the model is trained, you can generate new musical notes by providing an initial sequence. The model will predict subsequent notes based on the learned patterns. Experiment with different seed sequences for varied outputs.
