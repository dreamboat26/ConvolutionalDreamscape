# Image Classification

## About

This tutorial shows how to classify images of flowers using a tf.keras.Sequential model and load data using tf.keras.utils.image_dataset_from_directory. It demonstrates the following concepts:
- Efficiently loading a dataset off disk.
- Identifying overfitting and applying techniques to mitigate it, including data augmentation and dropout.

## Workflow
This tutorial follows a basic machine learning workflow:
- Examine and understand data
- Build an input pipeline
- Build the model
- Train the model
- Test the model
- Improve the model and repeat the process
