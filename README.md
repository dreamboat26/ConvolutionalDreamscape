# Data Augmentation

## About

This tutorial demonstrates data augmentation: a technique to increase the diversity of your training set by applying random (but realistic) transformations, such as image rotation.

# Objectives
You will learn how to apply data augmentation in two ways:
- Use the Keras preprocessing layers, such as tf.keras.layers.Resizing, tf.keras.layers.Rescaling, tf.keras.layers.RandomFlip, and tf.keras.layers.RandomRotation.
- Use the tf.image methods, such as tf.image.flip_left_right, tf.image.rgb_to_grayscale, tf.image.adjust_brightness, tf.image.central_crop, and tf.image.stateless_random.
