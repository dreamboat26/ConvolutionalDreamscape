# Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) 

## About

This tutorial provides a hands-on demonstration of preprocessing audio files in the WAV format and building a basic Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) model. The goal is to recognize ten different spoken words using a subset of the Speech Commands dataset (Warden, 2018). This dataset consists of short audio clips, each lasting one second or less, containing various spoken commands like "down," "go," "left," "no," "right," "stop," "up," and "yes."

While real-world speech and audio recognition systems can be intricate, this tutorial parallels the concept of image classification using the MNIST dataset, offering an introductory insight into the underlying techniques involved.

## Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have the following:
   - Basic understanding of machine learning concepts.
   - Familiarity with libraries like TensorFlow, and Keras.
   - Familiarity with Fourier Tranformation. 

## Tutorial Outline
   ### Data Preparation:
      - Download a portion of the Speech Commands dataset.
      - Explore the dataset and its directory structure.
      - Preprocess audio files in WAV format.
   ### Model Building:
      - Design a simple ASR model architecture.
      - Convert audio signals into suitable features.
      - Build and compile the ASR model using TensorFlow/Keras.
   ### Model Training:
      - Split the dataset into training and validation sets.
      - Train the ASR model using the prepared dataset.
      - Monitor training progress and prevent overfitting.
   ### Evaluation:
      - Evaluate the trained model on a test dataset.
      - Calculate recognition accuracy and performance metrics.
   ### Inference:
      - Implement a function to transcribe spoken words.
      - Test the ASR model on new audio samples.
   ### Conclusion:
      - Recap the key concepts covered in the tutorial.
      - Highlight the significance of ASR in real-world applications.

By following this tutorial, you'll gain foundational knowledge about ASR, audio preprocessing, and basic model building for speech recognition. Although actual ASR systems are intricate, this tutorial serves as a starting point for your exploration into this fascinating field.
