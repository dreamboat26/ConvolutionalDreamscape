# Basic CNN Implementation for CIFAR Classification

Welcome to the first branch of my repository, where I've laid out the foundational steps for implementing a basic Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify CIFAR images. This tutorial demonstrates how to build, train, and evaluate a simple CNN model using the Keras Sequential API. By following these steps, you'll quickly grasp the essentials of CNN architecture and gain insights into image classification.

## About

In this branch, you'll find the fundamental code and explanations needed to create a basic CNN model. This serves as an entry point for beginners who want to understand the building blocks of CNNs and their application in image classification tasks.

## Features
- Simplified Learning: With the Keras Sequential API, you'll be able to understand and implement a CNN model with just a few lines of code.
- Hands-On Experience: Walk through the process of preprocessing CIFAR images, constructing the CNN architecture, training the model, and evaluating its performance.
- Clear Explanations: Each step is accompanied by clear explanations, allowing you to grasp the concepts behind CNN layers, activation functions, pooling, and more.
- Interactive Code: The Jupyter notebook provided in this branch allows you to execute code cells step by step, observing the changes and results in real time.
- Visualization: Learn how to visualize intermediate feature maps and filters to gain insights into how the model interprets image features.
- Hyperparameter Tuning: Experiment with adjusting hyperparameters such as learning rate, batch size, and number of epochs to observe their impact on training.
- Model Interpretability: Gain an introduction to techniques like Grad-CAM to understand which parts of the image contribute most to the model's decisions.

## Getting Started
- To begin your journey with basic CNN implementation for CIFAR classification, follow these steps:
